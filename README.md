# How to use

## Text Layers

To insert an SF Symbol into a text layer, make sure you double-click the text layer to enter editing-mode. Move your cursor to the appropriate position and run the Insert Symbol command (`Control+Shift+F`) from Plugins > Francisco.

## Override Layers

Inserting an SF Symbol in an override (on the canvas) is done the same way as Text Layers. Be sure to double-click to enter edit mode.

## Overrides

You can also insert an SF Symbol into text overrides via the Inspector.

## Layer Names

Sometimes you may also want to add SF Symbols to names of layers or pages. Double-click a layer name in the layer list, or hit `Command+R` on the keyboard, then summon Francisco to help you search and insert an SF Symbol within the layer list.

## No Selection

You can also search for SF Symbols when you're not editing a text field, but the selected symbol will be copied to your clipboard instead.

## Limitations

- If you share your Sketch document with someone who does not have the SF Symbols app, they will see empty squares in place of the symbols. This is because Francisco only includes unicode values for the symbols, not the actual symbols. Please see the [Missing SF Symbols](https://www.sketch.com/support/troubleshooting/sf-symbols-missing/) article in Sketch Help for the most up-to-date instructions.
- Please be mindful of the [licensing restrictions](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/) related to using SF Symbols in your designs. ![Licensing](img/licensing.png?raw=true)
- Francisco does not work in the Sketch Components View (for now).
